## Main Story

### English Translation

Marc arrives in Paris for the first time. He is very excited but also a little nervous. He gets off the train at Gare du Nord with his large red suitcase.

"What should I do now?" Marc wonders. He looks around and sees many people. People are walking fast, they're talking on the phone or they're reading their newspapers.

Marc looks for a station map. He approaches a SNCF employee who is wearing a blue uniform.

"Excuse me, sir, where is the exit to the metro?" Marc asks politely.

"Hello! The metro exit is over there, to the left of the escalator," the employee replies with a smile.

"Thank you very much! And what would you advise me for getting to the city center?" Marc continues.

"Take line 4 direction Porte d'Orléans. It's direct to Châtelet," the employee explains.

Marc thanks the man and heads toward the metro. On the escalator, he observes the Parisians: some are reading their books, others are listening to music with their headphones.

In the metro, Marc finds a seat. He takes out his phone to look at his hotel address. "Hotel des Jardins, near the Louvre," he reads quietly.

An elderly lady next to him smiles and says: "It's your first time in Paris, isn't it?"

"Yes, madam. How do you know?" Marc replies, surprised.

"You're looking at everything with amazed eyes. It's magnificent!" the lady laughs kindly.

## Grammar Explanations

### Present Tense - Regular Verbs
**Explanation:**
Regular verbs in the present tense follow fixed patterns according to their ending (-er, -ir, -re).

**Examples from the story:**
1. Marc **arrives** in Paris. (arriver - -er verb)
2. He **gets off** the train. (descendre - -re verb)
3. People **walk** fast. (marcher - -er verb)

**Usage Rules:**
- -er verbs: je -e, tu -es, il/elle -e, nous -ons, vous -ez, ils/elles -ent
- -ir verbs: je -is, tu -is, il/elle -it, nous -issons, vous -issez, ils/elles -issent
- -re verbs: je -s, tu -s, il/elle -, nous -ons, vous -ez, ils/elles -ent

**Common Mistakes:**
Forgetting the 's' in the 2nd person singular for -re verbs.

**Practice Tip:**
Repeat conjugations aloud to memorize the endings.

### Verb "être" (to be)
**Explanation:**
The verb "être" is irregular and essential in French.

2. **Where is** the exit? (Où est la sortie?)

**Usage Rules:**
je suis, tu es, il/elle est, nous sommes, vous êtes, ils/elles sont

**Common Mistakes:**
Confusing "est" (être) and "et" (and).

**Practice Tip:**
Use "être" to describe states and professions.

### Question Formation with "qu'est-ce que"
**Explanation:**
"Qu'est-ce que" is used to ask questions about a direct object.

**Examples from the story:**
1. **What** should I do? (Qu'est-ce que je dois faire?)
2. **What** do you advise me? (Qu'est-ce que vous me conseillez?)

**Usage Rules:**
Qu'est-ce que + subject + verb + (complement)

2. **Where is** the metro located? (Où se trouve le métro?)

**Usage Rules:**
Où + verb + subject (inversion) OR Où + subject + verb

**Practice Tip:**
"Où" = where, "ou" = or.

---

### Prepositions of Place
**Explanation:**
Prepositions of place indicate the position of an object or person.

**Examples from the story:**
1. **To the left** of the escalator (à gauche de l'escalator)
2. **To the city center** (au centre-ville)
3. **In the metro** (dans le métro)
4. **Near** the Louvre (près du Louvre)
5. **Next to** him (à côté de lui)

**Usage Rules:**
- à = to/at/in (for cities, specific places)
- dans = in/inside (interior)
- près de = near
- à côté de = next to
- à gauche/droite de = to the left/right of

**Common Mistakes:**
Confusing "à" and "dans", incorrect contractions with articles.

**Practice Tip:**
"À" for destinations, "dans" for interior.
