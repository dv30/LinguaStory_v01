## Main Story

### English Translation

Marc arrived in front of Hotel des Jardins after twenty minutes on the metro. He easily found the hotel thanks to the directions from the lady on the metro. The hotel has an elegant facade with white and red flowers at the windows.

"Good morning, sir. Do you have a reservation?" asks the receptionist with a professional smile.

"Yes, I reserved a room for three nights. My name is Marc Dubois," he replies while taking out his passport.

The receptionist checks on her computer. "Perfect! You have room 205 on the second floor. Here is your key and here is some information about the neighborhood."

Marc takes the key and goes up to his room. It's small but comfortable, with a view of a typical small Parisian street. He puts his suitcase on the bed and looks out the window.

"Now, I'm going to explore the neighborhood," he tells himself. He's hungry and he's going to look for a café to have some coffee and some croissants.

On the street, Marc discovers a small café called "Café de la Paix". He enters and sits at a table near the window.

"Hello! What are you going to have?" asks the waiter, a friendly man of about forty years old.

"I'm going to have a coffee and a croissant, please. And do you have some orange juice?" Marc asks.

"Of course! Fresh orange juice. Did you just arrive in Paris?" asks the curious waiter.

"Yes, I took the train this morning. I'm going to stay three days. What would you recommend for visiting the neighborhood?"

The waiter thinks for a moment. "Well, you're very close to the Louvre. This afternoon, you'll be able to visit the Tuileries gardens. It's magnificent in this season. And tonight, you can go to the restaurant 'Chez Marie' to taste some authentic French cuisine."

"Thank you very much! I can't wait to discover all that," says Marc with enthusiasm.

While he's drinking his coffee, Marc observes Parisian life through the window. People pass by with their dogs, cyclists navigate between cars, and shopkeepers arrange their store windows.

"Paris really has a unique atmosphere," he thinks. "Tomorrow, I'm going to visit the Louvre and I'm going to take some photos for my friends."

## Grammar Explanations

### Passé Composé
**Explanation:**
The passé composé expresses a completed action in the past. It's formed with the auxiliary avoir or être + past participle.

**Examples from the story:**
1. Marc **arrived** in front of the hotel. (est arrivé - être + arrivé)
2. He **found** the hotel easily. (a trouvé - avoir + trouvé)
3. I **reserved** a room. (ai réservé - avoir + réservé)
4. I **took** the train this morning. (ai pris - avoir + pris)

**Usage Rules:**
- With "avoir": j'ai mangé, tu as fini, il a pris
- With "être": je suis allé(e), tu es venu(e), il est parti
- Past participle agreement with "être"
- 14 main verbs use "être" (aller, venir, partir, arriver, etc.)

**Common Mistakes:**
Forgetting past participle agreement with "être", confusing auxiliaries.

**Practice Tip:**
Memorize the "house of être" with the 14 movement verbs.

### Partitive Articles (du, de la, des)
**Explanation:**
Partitive articles express an indefinite quantity of an uncountable thing.

**Examples from the story:**
1. to have **some coffee** (prendre du café)
2. **some croissants** (des croissants)
3. **some orange juice** (du jus d'orange)
4. **some French cuisine** (de la cuisine française)
5. **some information** (des informations)
6. **some photos** (des photos)

**Usage Rules:**
- du = de + le (masculine singular)
- de la = (feminine singular)
- des = de + les (plural)
- de l' = (before vowel)

**Common Mistakes:**
Using definite articles (le, la, les) instead of partitives.

**Practice Tip:**
"Some" in English = partitive article in French.

---

### Future Proche (aller + infinitive)
**Explanation:**
The near future expresses a near future action or an intention.

**Examples from the story:**
1. I **am going to explore** the neighborhood (je vais explorer)
2. he **is going to look for** a café (il va chercher)
3. **What are you going to have**? (Qu'est-ce que vous allez prendre?)
4. you **are going to be able to** visit (vous allez pouvoir)
5. you **can go** to the restaurant (vous pouvez aller)
6. I **am going to visit** the Louvre (je vais visiter)

**Usage Rules:**
Aller (conjugated) + verb in infinitive
- je vais, tu vas, il/elle va, nous allons, vous allez, ils/elles vont

**Common Mistakes:**
Confusing with the present tense of "aller" (movement).

**Practice Tip:**
Near future = intention or near future action in time.
